// Marina Marot CS2 assignment "First C++ Practice"

// comments for Adrian  
// 1. unsure if this is correct way to submit the assignments via GutHub
// 2. unsure if the MAIN function in C++ is the equivalent to DRAW/SETUP in Processing or just a regular method we use to do something

//code begins
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

char blackbox()
{
  char word = eat; 
  cout << "Word can be eat, sleep or code" << endl;
  cout << "Word is set to" << word << endl;

  return char;


}

int main()
{
  
   // depending on what the variable, system prints a diiferent statement
   
   if (word = eat)
   {cout << "You should be sleeping" << endl;
   }
   else if (word = sleep)
   {cout << "You should be coding" << endl;
   }
   else (word = code)
   {cout << "You should be eating" << endl;
   }

  return 0;
